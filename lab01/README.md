CS 262 - Lab 1
This lab is based on https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/01introduction/lab.html

I had to let the quote, "Hello, Seongrim!", to appear on my phone through expo.

Answers to the lab questions:
1. App.js: display in the app
2. package.json: keep track of the versions of debugger and dependencies
3. node_modules: packages that is imported into the device
4. .gitignore: files that git should ignore
